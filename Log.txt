Day 5: 8/9/17
1. Try to scrape multiple pages for point per game, per season, post seasons and so on, and realize that the columns in each table are different, it is not like multiple pages by different years.
2. Suddenly realize that if I want to make my own website, I can't scrape every table I want to make from existing website. What I need to do is to have an original copy of all the data of games, teams and players and do the stats on them and make the table. So I decide to scrape espn.go.com/nba/teams/...
3. Followe http://danielfrg.com/blog/2013/04/01/nba-scraping-data/ and revised the python code because some of the codes don't work, maybe the website has been changed after the author wrote the blog.
4. Learne some methods to trouble-shooting the python code from Dong.

Day 5: 8/10/17
1. Scraping multiple page could be a challange, there will be a lot of codes needs to be revised. Teams change, players name change, etc.
2. Find out that espn.go.com/nba/ only have data from 2002 to present, which is a problem, because I want to get the stats from the very beginning of NBA.
3. So maybe find another instruction to scrape from http://stats.nba.com/ or change my current code.
4. The whole picture of making a website is still not clear.
